Overall, the month-wise sales started around 35 k in January, rose to about 44 k in February, dipped to roughly 29 k in March, then climbed steadily through April and peaked at over 53 k in May. This indicates an early-spring slowdown in March, followed by a robust upswing into late spring, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions or inventory boosts during the slower month.
